# ChemEco
A General-Purpose Framework for Data Mining Without Coding

ChemEco is a flexible and versatile framework to compile a diverse collection of data mining and machine learning techniques from different sources. It allows the user to build and run an arbitrary graph of operations via configuration files and graphical user interface (GUI). The customizable templates that are provided in the GUI share best practices in many data mining projects. 

Our research is mainly focused on machine learning for quantum mechanics to accelerate materials discovery. But, the domain-specific methods and techniques are mostly provided in other packages, i.e, ChemML and ChemLG. Thus, ChemEco also facilitate the broader dissemination of available methods at the interface of chemical and data sciences.
